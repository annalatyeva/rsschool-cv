## Projects:
1. [Portfolio for brand specialist](https://github.com/annalatyeva/anna-katsur-portfolio) - This project is a portfolio of a branding and design specialist, developed using React. The website uses React Router DOM for navigation through sections, React Player for embedding video content, classnames for convenient class management of elements, and SCSS for styling using a preprocessor.
2. [Application for learning foreign words](https://github.com/annalatyeva/word-learning-app) - This React project helps users learn foreign words effectively with two main modes: a word list with translations and a flashcard feature for studying. Each flashcard reveals a foreign word and translation with a click. It also includes a custom 404 error page for navigation issues.
3. [Dashboard for choosing a city to live](https://github.com/annalatyeva/best-city-dashboard) - This project compares important factors like average salary, air pollution, population density, housing prices, temperature, regional development, and demographics in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and Yekaterinburg. It used Chart.js and Tabby.js libraries for the implementation.
